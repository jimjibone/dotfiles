# Builds darksky ubuntu (jimjibone/dotfiles based) which is a remastered live CD.
# See example grub.cfg in etc/ to boot from a flash drive.
# Uses current branch.

# Incremental approach, using an existing ISO.

# Use the 'toram' kernel parameter. The result is a super-fast, disposable
# environment! You'll need at least 3GB of RAM though.
#
# Based on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization

# Modes of operation:
#
# 1. Source and Target non-existent: New source is downloaded, target is compiled
# 2. Target exists: Target is used as source
# 3. Just source exists: New target is created

# To virtualise and test:

#sudo apt-get install qemu kvm
#sudo adduser jimjibone kvm
#qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -usbdevice tablet -k en-gb -vnc :0,lossy -vga std -cdrom darkbuntu-jimjibone.iso
#
# After this, on an intermediate host
#
# forward port 5900, which is :0
#ssh -g -L 5900:localhost:5900 jimjibone@chell.darksky.io
#
#
# Then connect using a vncviewer. Performance is pretty much as if it was
# local due to kvm and vnc. The letdown is really the fancy effects making
# it slow.
