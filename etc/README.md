Put misc things here. For example:
  * Windows hacks
  * Reference
  * Some dependencies



# com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

Decent iTerm 2 settings (Black, Menlo) installed with OS X preset.

# putty.reg

Decent putty settings (Consolas font)

Note that putty can't relay the correct escape codes to support large (>96
cols) terminals on mouse mode. see
http://superuser.com/questions/413351/weird-insertion-from-vim-on-mouse-click
so the terminal is set to the maximum size for mouse usage.

# disable-caps-lock.reg

Suddenly, the caps lock is disabled on windows after reboot. Yay!

For windows 7, [dual monitor taskbar][1] is recommended.
